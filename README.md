## Requirements:
python3 , keras , numpy , sklearn , pickle , pandas .</br> Platform used is [colab](https://colab.research.google.com/)

## Algorithims:
 :one: Kmeans </br> Accuracy obtained is 68% </br>
 :two: Neural Networks </br>
 Accuracy obtained is 83.65% But this shows a clear overfitting of the training data</br>
 ## Conclusion:
 Thus neural networks are used only when we have bulk of data to avoid overfitting.
